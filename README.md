# AXI2APB-Bridge-Design-and-Verification
In this repository, the RTL design and verification of the axi2apb bridge communication protocol are realized. In this system, the preferred AXI bus will be axi4-lite and the APB bus will be APB3. The design code written using VHDL and the verification part is written using SystemVerilog language. You can run the compile.do file and can get the results. The software used is QuestaSim 2021-1. 
You can find the more detailed information about the bridge protocol by looking at the AXI to APB Bridge LogiCORE IP Product Guide.
