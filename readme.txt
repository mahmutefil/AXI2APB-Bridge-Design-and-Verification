Follow the steps below to compile the project;

-Create new project and copy all the files inside the /code/src folder into your project directory. (including compile.do file)
-Open QuestaSim script and command "do compile.do". It will automatically start the process using the code
inside the compile.do file. You can vary the compilation time to drive the code for longer or shorter time. 

**Note: The project will be compiling 4 times inside compile.do file. The reason is that the library folders of the 
AXI_VIP are recognized after the 4th compilation.  

**Note: The software used is QuestaSim 2021-1.
