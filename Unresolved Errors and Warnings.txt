Unresolved Errors and Warnings
1.
# ERROR: 215 ns tb.axi_mst.inst.IF  : XILINX_NO_STRB_ADDRESS: Address is not aligned 
with data width. Connection has been declared to No STRB. To downgrade, 
use <hierarchy_path to VIP>.IF.set_xilinx_no_strb_address_check_to_warn(), or filter 
using clr_xilinx_no_strb_address_check().
# ** Error: [axi_mst_agent_monitor] (axi_vip_pkg.axi_monitor.axi_monitor__1.check_burst.
NO_STRB) 355 ns : AXI Address (0x451b475b) cannot be unaligned when HAS_STRB is 0.

Since the strobed write is not included in the RTL design file while generating the 
bridge code, this error caused by the AXI VIP Master can be ignored.

2.  (vip outputları ve benim sürmediklerimde gelen cblock hatalarını görmezden gel)
# ** Warning: axi_intf.sv(38): (vopt-3838) Variable 'axi_rready' written by continuous 
and procedural assignments. 
# One of the assignments is implicit. See ./tb.sv(63). Variable is procedurally driven 
by axi_rready in clocking block axi_master_cb. See (axi_intf.sv:40).

This example warning occurs for all outputs of the AXI VIP, even though I don’t drive these signals. 
Therefore, this warning can be ignored. 

3.
** Warning: ./apb_slave.sv(4): (vlog-13233) Design unit "apb_slave_sv_unit" already exists and will
 be overwritten. Overwriting SystemVerilog $unit with different source files.

** Warning: ./axi_master.sv(6): (vlog-13233) Design unit "axi_master_sv_unit" already exists and will
 be overwritten. Overwriting SystemVerilog $unit with different source files.

The warnings that are shown above are caused by the decleration of the axi_trans package inside the 
apb_slave and axi_master classes. Since it is not possible to instantiate the axi_trans class using 
another method, this warning will pop up till I found another way.

4.
** Warning: (vlog-13361) ./axi_vip_axi4pc.sv(1195): No trigger event inferred in disable expression.

The warning stated above is sourced from the axi_vip_axi4pc SVA file and there are bunch of other similar 
warnings. These warnings state that no trigger event inferred but I don't know the exact solution for these.
